Configuration management is the aspect of software engineering concerned with developing and maintaining complex systems.  Thus far, I don't have much knowledge pertaining to the aforementioned subject.  I've only had a brief experience in the past where I was required to maintain the database of IT tickets for the company I worked for.  It was relatively simple and multiple users were able to update, close and create new documents throughout the course of a business day. However, I do realize how imperative it is to provide maintenance for the service we provided.  For example, one bug or the inability keep our system up-to-date with current standards could have rendered the company useless during a crucial moment.
