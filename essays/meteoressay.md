Meteor is like sweet and sour chicken.  At first glance, it's this superb tool that has limitless potential for web applications and is quite easy to organize, if you're a neat freak like myself.  However, after tinkering around for a bit, one might find themselves having to muster up quite a bit of patience, as meteor has a tendency to take eons to load.  Aside from the initial "What in the world am I doing?" phase, I've had a great time learning little tricks and secrets about making webpages coherent with current standards.

Starting off learning a new programming language tends to be the same, regardless of what you're learning.  As such, building my first "Hello World" webpage, with meteor, was rather simple.  Install a few files here, change a few lines of code there and voila!  Within a few minutes or so, you have your very own webpage saying "Hello World!"  After graduating from an elementary level, I was intoduced into the "big kids" club of meteor.  It began with implementing a template into my very own mockup of a contacts list.  Instead of dealing with only client-sided files, I had to broaden my horizon to the server-side of web applications.  I needed to ensure that each new file I added/deleted was updated within the router file, I edited the homepage to keep users from accessing files which no longer existed and stored user information into the mongo database.  I then pushed forward to giving the option of updating existing contacts, by accessing the id of the person within the corresponding Contacts collection.  

Don't get me wrong, these tasks weren't easy for me to understand (event handlers and helper functions are still somewhat of a gray area for me), but I do understand the overall idea behind creating a web application.  I look forward to working with this program in the future and adding it to my repertoire of software engineering tools.
