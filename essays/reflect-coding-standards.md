Coding standards are guidelines a programmer may choose to follow.  It defines the layout of the code, which functions to make use of and the length of a comment.  Although it may serve as a dilemma for some, the general populace appear to enjoy following these standards.

After a weeks worth of experience with ESLint, I've concluded I enjoy using it as a basis, with which, to write my code.  The tiny green check mark, in the upper right had corner of the IDE, has become a symbol of comfort.  When something is wrong, it's rather easy to identify the mistake, correct it and return that red mark to its original green state.  I have found, however, that ESLint has given me false hope at times.  After verifying my check mark, I quickly open a browser and test my code.  Although everything is written properly, according to the standard, my code doesn't execute as expected.  Thus, I must constantly remind myself, that although this tool is quite helpful, it shouldn't serve as a replacement for my own brain.

Coding standards are outstanding and keep programs, regardless of who writes it, uniformed and easy to read.  I've come to love them and can't wait to implement it with future assignments and projects.  Overtime, I'd also like to see how these guidlines evolve and make coding easier.
