During the preliminary stages of utilizing Semantic UI, there were several occasions where I wanted to throw my computer across the room. This is because I thoroughly enjoy the freedom of customizing every aspect of a webpage.  It's somewhat similar to determining which operating system to run.  I prefer controlling every aspect of a webpage, like a Linux user, as opposed to having presets to use, like a Windows user.  However, I've come to grow fond of Semantic UI.  It does simplify, the otherwise complex to read, code of a webpage.

After day two using Semantic UI, I've found that the ui container class was execptionally helpful.  It eliminated the need to create margins/padding and kept everything neat, regardless of what device you opened the webpage on.  It also neatly formatted segments of the webpage into neat rows/columns, whilst fluidly placing images between portions of headers or menus.  The ease it brought about truly compensated for the earlier frustration I exeprienced.

I will admit, the first day of using this framework was relatively stressful.  A lot of the functions didn't work as I expected and it took a decent amount of time to figure out how to use each one.  Although I did want to give up and return to the safety net, that is raw html code, I realize how important frameworks are.  Without them, we don't have a formal basis for creating webpages nor is easy to learn and implement.
