##WOD Can I Do?

Javascript is an amazing programming language.  Collectively, I've had about a days worth of experience with it and I'm truly impressed with what I'm able to do!  You are no longer required to specify variable types, the == and === operators are very useful and I enjoy how simple it is to make functions.  From a software engineering standpoint, I believe this extremely practical.  Code becomes easier to read and manage, while the inherent properties of other powerful languages, such as C++, remains constant.

Subjecting individuals to atheltic software engineering is genius!
