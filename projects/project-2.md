This project was created to demonstrate my proficiency with the C++ language and portray my knowledge of hash tables and their functions. It gives a user the option to select one of five protocols and consistently maintains a table of, at most, 7 names and numbers.  At any given time, you can access, display, insert or remove the data within the hash table.  Should the user enter an incorrect command or give the wrong format of a telephone number, the program will prompt the user with corresponding error and information will retain its original state.
